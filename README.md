Our website serves as a vital tool in emergency healthcare management, seamlessly connecting individuals in need with nearby hospitals during urgent situations. Leveraging sophisticated technology, including Geocoding API, Geolocation API, and Places API, our platform swiftly identifies the nearest healthcare facilities based on the user's location. This feature facilitates rapid navigation to the nearest hospital, ensuring timely access to critical medical care.

Furthermore, our system incorporates Twilio integration, enabling automated calls to be placed to the identified hospital. These calls transmit essential patient details along with the precise location of the emergency, enabling healthcare providers to prepare and respond promptly to the situation. This streamlined communication process enhances efficiency and coordination between individuals in distress and healthcare facilities, ultimately contributing to improved emergency response and patient outcomes.
